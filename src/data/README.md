# Data folder

This folder stores small, demo-friendly datasets that the frontend can load.

- `shots_sample.json` is a small sample used for the demo UI.
- Full raw datasets are not committed to GitHub (too large). Keep those locally.

If you regenerate the sample, document the steps in `/scripts`.
